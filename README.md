# Transformer
for review.

The above wonderful codes are excerpted from O'REILLY's excellent book, "Natural Language Processing with Transformers".
(Except the Decoder, That part is just my stupid struggle)

I also deeply appreciate Professor Juae Kim for giving me access to the book.
It's just a code I organized for my review, so there's a high possibility that there's something wrong with my English.
